      "Ek Hota Carver" ( Translation: There was a carver ), was a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hota-Carver-Marathi-Veena-Gavankar/dp/8174348190"> book </a> when I was in seventh grade. So much facinated I was by this man!! A scientist, an inventor and most importantly a struggler. The <em>struggler</em>  part touched me the most. A man who always strived for making learning something new and using it for humankind. A person who could not speak for some years excelled at singing and preaching. A very weak child who would have died made many lives better. A man who was rejected from many schools and institutes helped constructing <a href="http://www.tuskegee.edu/about_us/legacy_of_fame/george_w_carver.aspx"> Tuskegee University </a>. Numerous times I read this book, numerous times a cried, laughed and rejoiced.. I am using this project as an excuse to pay triute to a person from which I learned a lot during my childhood.
